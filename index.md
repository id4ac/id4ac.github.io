  ## Interactive Design with Autistic Children using LLM and IoT for Personalized Training: The Good, The Bad and The Challenging
---


# Workshop Description
The emergence of generative artificial intelligence technology such as Large Language Model (LLM), Large Vision Model (LVM) has presented promising outcomes in both academic and industrial domains and becomes ubiquitously used. However, still few works have been focused on implementing these technologies for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD). In the meantime, the mainstream personalized training with interactive design for children with special needs still faces potential challenges. As such, the goal of this workshop is to provide a platform for researchers, software and medical  practitioners, and designers to  share and debate both the pros and cons of the applying Large Language Model (LLM) and Internet of Things(IoT) for diagnosis and personalized training for autistic children. Through hosting multiple activities during the half-day workshop, including oral presentation, demo and panel discussion, we hope to use this opportunity to build a network of experts to dedicate our efforts on benefiting children with special needs and further inspire the research on taking advantage of the emerging ubiquitous technologies for these  under-privileged users, caregivers and special education teachers. 


# Call For Participation
This workshop explores the benefits, challenges, and future directions for involving creative interactive design using LLMs and IoT with/for autistic children in personalized training. By engaging in presentations, demonstrations, and group discussions, participants will have the chance to exchange their related experiences and insights. Submissions of position papers, work-in-progress reports, or demonstration papers for a short presentation or demonstration that related to the interactive design with autistic children using LLM and IoT for personalized training or relevant fields are welcomed. Specifically, the proposed workshop is expecting:
- Position papers (2-4 pages) discussing research questions, opportunities, benefits, or challenges
- Work-in-progress reports (2-4 pages) highlighting current research
- Demonstration papers (1 page) illustrating a leading-edge system in use, under development, or at a testing stage

The suggested topics include (but not limited to):
- Optimized and personalized training for special education
- AI, IoT, Smart Sensors for special education
- Large Language Models (LLMs), Large Vision Models (LVM) for special education
- Technology-Based Intervention(TBI) for special education
- Interactive design with children
- Emerging Applications for special education

Accepted works will be invited to present their submissions in a dedicated presentation or demo session.

# Pre-workship Plans
We are expecting the main target participants of the proposed workshop include researchers, designers, practitioners and children that are currently working on or being interested in the study involving Large Language Model(LLM), Large Visual Model(LVM), Internet-of-Things(IoT), and/or Smart Sensors for personalized training design for autistic children in an interactive approach. The various channels will be used to attract the potential participants, includes the mailing lists (e.g. CHI-kids mailing list), social medias (e.g. Tweet, Facebook, YouTube), university websites and conferences (e.g. DIS, CHI).


# Workshop Structure
This half-day (3-4 hours long) workshop will be served as a collective platform that brings together researchers, practitioners, designers and children with diverse cultures and background to share their recent works, applications and creative ideas that contribute to the area focused on interactive design with autistic children using LLM, LVM and/or IoT for personalized training. The proposed workshop structure is as follows:

1. **Welcome and Introduction** (15 minutes): The facilitator (one of the co-organizers) will introduce the theme of the workshop: Interactive design with autistic children using LLM and IoT for personalized training, followed by sharing the workshop agenda, addressing challenges and objectives.
2. **Keynote Speech** (25 minutes): The invited keynote speaker will deliver a talk on the topic of emerging Technology-Based Intervention(TBI) researching trends for children with autism and other neurodevelopmental Disorders.
3. **Short Presentations** (80 minutes): We are expecting to have up to 8 groups of participants and each group will give a 7-minute presentation on their position papers and work-in-progress reports and followed by a 3-minute short Q&A session.
4. **Demos and Coffee Break** (60 minutes): Up to 10 groups of participants present their demos or applications in an open setting related to our workshop theme, including leading-edge systems in use, under development, or at a testing stage and art installations such as prototypes, devices, games and videos.
5. **Open Discussion and Brainstorm** (30 minutes): Discussion on the current research works/outcomes, trends and challenges of involving LLM and IoT in interactive design with autistic children for assisting personalized learning for autistic children and brainstorming the potential future directions of the future works.
6. **Closing and wrap-up** (20 minutes):Recap of workshop key points; Gratitude and acknowledgments.


# Post-workshop Plans
To continue the long-term impact of the workshop and the creation of tangible outcomes, the following follow-up activities will be arranged: synchronizing all works (position papers, work-in-progress reports, and demonstration papers) presented in the proposed workshop and discuss outcomes on our workshop website with the permission from the author; inviting workshop participants to publish their works in a selected Journal Special Issue.
